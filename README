1. Introduction

AsciiArtist is a small utility app which converts
an input image to a ASCII art in PDF. It's written
in Java/Swing and uses Apache PDFBox library to
generate PDF files.

2. Algorithm description

Both versions of conversion algorithm work on the
one pixel -> one letter principle. The image is
preprocessed by scaling it down, then scaling to
match the used font's width/height proportions.
Afterwards, grayscale conversion is applied.

Simple version performs the transformation by
counting non-white pixels of a character and
transforming it to [0;1] normalized value range.
Currently processed pixel has its luminosity
converted to the [0;1] too. Then, we choose the
character that is closest to the pixel's value
in the terms of normalized value difference.

Extended algorithm version takes into account not
only the currently processed pixel, but also its
surroundings. Every character in ASCII set is
divided to 9 parts (3x3) and each part has its
non-white pixels counted and luminosity converted
to [0;1] range. Pixel luminosity value conversion
is the same as before. The pixel - character
Euclidean distance function is given as follows:

character division 3x3:
c1 c2 c3
c4 c5 c6
c7 c8 c9

pixel and surroundings:
p1 p2 p3
p4 p5 p6
p7 p8 p9

(p5 is the currently processed pixel)

dist = sqrt((c1 - p1) ^ 2 + ... + (c9 - p9) ^ 2)

3. External usage

You are free to use the code in your own applications,
mentioning the authorship. Probably AsciiArtConverter
and PDFExporter are the classes of main interest.
